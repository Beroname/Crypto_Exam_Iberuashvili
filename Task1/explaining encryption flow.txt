Step 1: Making the Special Keys
First, User A makes two special keys:

Public Key: Like a lock that anyone can use to lock things

Private Key: Like the key that only User A has to unlock things

Step 2: Sending a Secret Message
When User B wants to send a secret message:

Make a Secret Code: The program creates a random secret code (AES key)

Lock the Message: Use the secret code to lock the actual message

Lock the Secret Code: Use User A's public lock to lock the secret code itself

Send Both: Send the locked message and locked secret code to User A

Step 3: Reading the Secret Message
When User A gets the message:

Unlock the Secret Code: Use their private key to unlock the secret code

Unlock the Message: Use the secret code to unlock the actual message

Read It: Now they can read the original message!

Why We Use Two Locks?
We use both AES and RSA because:

AES is really fast for locking big messages

RSA is really good for safely sharing secret codes

Together they work perfectly!

Files Our Program Makes:
message.txt - The original message before locking

encrypted_message.bin - The locked message (looks like garbage)

aes_key_encrypted.bin - The locked secret code

decrypted_message.txt - The unlocked message (same as original)

public_key.pem - User A's lock (safe to share with everyone)

private_key.pem - User A's key (KEEP THIS SECRET!)
