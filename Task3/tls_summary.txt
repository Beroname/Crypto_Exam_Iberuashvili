
What I Found:

1. CERTIFICATES:
   - Website has a certificate from site
   - It's verified by a certificate authority

2. ENCRYPTION:
   - TLS Version: (put what you found from openssl)
   - Cipher: (put what you found from openssl)

3. WHAT TLS DOES:

   Privacy (Confidentiality):
   - TLS scrambles messages so only you and website can read them
   - Like talking in secret code

   Safety (Integrity):
   - TLS checks if messages were changed during sending
   - Like sealed envelopes that show if opened

4. WHAT I SAW IN WIRESHARK:
   - Client Hello: My computer said hello to website
   - Server Certificate: Website showed its ID card
   - Key Exchange: They agreed on a secret code
