How Digital Signatures Work:

1. SIGNING (Alice):
   - Alice creates a unique fingerprint of her message using SHA-256
   - She encrypts this fingerprint with her private key (this is the signature)
   - Only Alice can do this because only she has the private key

2. VERIFYING (Bob):
   - Bob gets the message and signature from Alice
   - He decrypts the signature using Alice's public key to get the fingerprint
   - He also creates his own fingerprint of the message using SHA-256
   - If both fingerprints match, it proves:
     * Alice sent the message (authentication)
     * Message wasn't changed (integrity)

It's like a wax seal:
- Only Alice has the seal stamp (private key)
- Anyone can recognize Alice's seal (public key)
- If seal is broken, someone tampered with the message
